## About the Project
The project was created for the [2024 ShapeCraft Hackathon.](https://shape.network/shapecraft)
Category: New Worlds

The goal of this project was to implement the following features if time and talent allowed: 
- Once the user logs in, their default NFT is automatically minted on the Shape Mainnet
- The NFT has updatable metadata to allow for future avatar asset and trait add-ons
- With the NFT linked to the account, it would also be allowed to transfer to other worlds through the `Avatar.tsx` component
- The dashboard would provide links to other worlds built on this one as its account base with gas-back incentives

The architecture was specifically aimed to create a seamless and simplified WEB3 onboarding experience. 
As an artist, I wanted to address infamous WEB3 onboarding issues as I integrated the ShapeCraft Worlds concept.  
- Alchemy's Account Kit makes creating a WEB3 account simple and easy
- Receiving a free Shape Mainnet Default NFT automatically during login allows users to play with token-gated security and no immediate paywalls.
- A dynamic NFT with updatable off-chain metadata and sprite sheets provides a scalable solution for additional assets without re-mints, saving gas. 
- A familiar character creator interface for visual customization and metadata refreshes removes the need for third-party redirects. 

## Demo Project 
Due to time and expertise constraints, this demo project has the following features in place:
- Account Kit login to Shape Mainnet 
- Character Creation with multiple asset options
- Foundation for future additions
- Avatar saved to localstorage and linked to the account address for easy transfer to other worlds via metadata.
